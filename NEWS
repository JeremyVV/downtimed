               downtimed - system downtime reporting tool

                           version history

version 0.5 released 2011-03-02

 - Fixed a bug which prevented creation of the required time stamp
   files in case command line option -S was set.

 - Determine boot time on some SVR4 systems such as Solaris.

 - Compatibility for systems which do not have flock() but have lockf(),
   such as Solaris.

 - Compatibility for systems without facilitynames in <syslog.h>, such
   as Solaris.

 - Compatibility daemon(3) function for OSes which do not have it, such
   as Solaris.

 - Compatibility for systems which lack futimes(3) function, such as
   Solaris.

 - Log an error message if system boot time can not be determined.

 - Remove dependency on be64toh(3) and betoh64(3). Or betoh64(3) and
   htobe64(3). Or OSSwapBigToHostInt64(3) and OSSwapHostToBigInt64(3).
   The code became a mess because 64 bit byte swapping is not standardized.

   Also some commonly used GNU/Linux distributions such as RHEL/CentOS 5.5
   have such an old glibc that it does not include any of these functions.

   Now we just implement our own byte swapping macro and ignore whatever
   is or is not available from the system. This improves portability
   on many platforms, for example on CentOS, RedHat (RHEL) and Solaris.

 - Improve README documentation regarding startup scripts.

 - Example startup scripts have been moved to the "startup-scripts"
   sub-directory.

 - openSUSE startup script by Federico Lucifredi <flucifredi@acm.org>.

 - OpenBSD compatibility improvements.

 - Debian GNU/kFreeBSD compatibility improvements.

 - Use volatile sig_atomic_t if available for flags set by signal handlers.

 - Other minor fixes.

version 0.4 released 2010-12-25

 - Do not create the data directory /var/{db,lib}/downtimed in the
   daemon. It should be created by the system administrator or the
   package maintainer instead. Problem reported by Mats Erik Andersson
   <openbsd@gisladisker.se>.

 - OpenBSD support and other minor fixes by Mats Erik
   Andersson <openbsd@gisladisker.se>.

 - Debian GNU/kFreeBSD support by Mats Erik Andersson
   <openbsd@gisladisker.se>.

 - Change backwards lseek(2) to forward lseek(2) as the backwards seek
   fails on some platforms, by Mats Erik Andersson <openbsd@gisladisker.se>.

 - Other minor fixes.

version 0.3 released 2010-10-26

 - Mac OS X support by Henrik Ahlgren <pablo@seestieto.com>

 - Fix man page rendering on various OSes such as FreeBSD (we were
   using non-standard .SY, .YS and .OP macros) [this has no
   effect on GNU/Linux, no need to upgrade]

 - Fix printf format string to avoid compiler warnings

version 0.2 released 2010-09-22

 - implemented downtimes(1) command for displaying the contents of
   the downtime database in human readable format

 - implemented downtime database in the downtimed(8) daemon

 - moved the location of data files from /var/lib/misc/downtimed/
   to /var/lib/downtimed/ on Linux.

 - the default sleep time between time stamp updates is now 15 seconds
   instead of 5 as previously

 - minor documentation improvements

version 0.1 released 2010-05-22
