               downtimed - system downtime reporting tool

                           version history

version 1.0 released 2016-05-24

 - This is mainly a maintenance release. There are no significant new
   features. The software appears to be so stable that it is the time to
   release 1.0 now.

 - Add downtimed(8) command line option -F for enabling seamless
   operation with modern system service supervisors such as systemd(8) and
   others. This option disables calling daemon(3) and thus fork(2)ing into
   the background. In systemd(8) terminology this is a [Service] Type=
   "simple".

 - Eliminate #ifndef __APPLE__ in the code. OS X users must now add the -F
   option described above to their downtimed(8) launchd(8) configuration.
   The example configuration startup-scripts/com.epipe.downtimed.plist was
   updated accordingly.

 - Add systemd.service(5) file in startup-scripts/downtimed.service.

 - Add -f command line option to usage help strings. Reported and a patch
   supplied by Mats Erik Andersson. Thanks!

 - Update autotools produced scripts, build-aux.

 - Moved code hosting from Launchpad to GitHub. The new location is:

     https://github.com/snabb/downtimed

   Also README was changed to README.md.

 - Miscellaneous minor improvements and changes in the documentation.


version 0.6 released 2013-07-27

 - Added startup scripts for Debian, Red Hat (RHEL/Fedora/Scientific
   Linux/CentOS/etc.), Arch Linux and OpenIndiana/OpenSolaris.

 - Implemented -f command line option for downtimes(1) and downtimed(8).
   It can be used to specify the desired time and date format for
   reporting. The default remains "%F %T".

 - Implemented -u command line option for downtimes(1) for reporting
   times in UTC. Analogous to "date -u".

 - GNU/Hurd compatibility fixes contributed by Mats Erik Andersson.

 - FreeBSD 9 compatibility fix by Douglas Thrift.


version 0.5 released 2011-03-02

 - Fixed a bug which prevented creation of the required time stamp
   files in case command line option -S was set.

 - Determine boot time on some SVR4 systems such as Solaris.

 - Compatibility for systems which do not have flock() but have lockf(),
   such as Solaris.

 - Compatibility for systems without facilitynames in <syslog.h>, such
   as Solaris.

 - Compatibility daemon(3) function for OSes which do not have it, such
   as Solaris.

 - Compatibility for systems which lack futimes(3) function, such as
   Solaris.

 - Log an error message if system boot time can not be determined.

 - Remove dependency on be64toh(3) and betoh64(3). Or betoh64(3) and
   htobe64(3). Or OSSwapBigToHostInt64(3) and OSSwapHostToBigInt64(3).
   The code became a mess because 64 bit byte swapping is not standardized.

   Also some commonly used GNU/Linux distributions such as RHEL/CentOS 5.5
   have such an old glibc that it does not include any of these functions.

   Now we just implement our own byte swapping macro and ignore whatever
   is or is not available from the system. This improves portability
   on many platforms, for example on Red Hat (RHEL) and Solaris.

 - Improve README documentation regarding startup scripts.

 - Example startup scripts have been moved to the "startup-scripts"
   sub-directory.

 - openSUSE startup script by Federico Lucifredi <flucifredi@acm.org>.

 - OpenBSD compatibility improvements.

 - Debian GNU/kFreeBSD compatibility improvements.

 - Use volatile sig_atomic_t if available for flags set by signal handlers.

 - Other minor fixes.


version 0.4 released 2010-12-25

 - Do not create the data directory /var/{db,lib}/downtimed in the
   daemon. It should be created by the system administrator or the
   package maintainer instead. Problem reported by Mats Erik Andersson
   <openbsd@gisladisker.se>.

 - OpenBSD support and other minor fixes by Mats Erik
   Andersson <openbsd@gisladisker.se>.

 - Debian GNU/kFreeBSD support by Mats Erik Andersson
   <openbsd@gisladisker.se>.

 - Change backwards lseek(2) to forward lseek(2) as the backwards seek
   fails on some platforms, by Mats Erik Andersson <openbsd@gisladisker.se>.

 - Other minor fixes.


version 0.3 released 2010-10-26

 - Mac OS X support by Henrik Ahlgren <pablo@seestieto.com>

 - Fix man page rendering on various OSes such as FreeBSD (we were
   using non-standard .SY, .YS and .OP macros) [this has no
   effect on GNU/Linux, no need to upgrade]

 - Fix printf format string to avoid compiler warnings


version 0.2 released 2010-09-22

 - implemented downtimes(1) command for displaying the contents of
   the downtime database in human readable format

 - implemented downtime database in the downtimed(8) daemon

 - moved the location of data files from /var/lib/misc/downtimed/
   to /var/lib/downtimed/ on Linux.

 - the default sleep time between time stamp updates is now 15 seconds
   instead of 5 as previously

 - minor documentation improvements


version 0.1 released 2010-05-22

 - initial release
